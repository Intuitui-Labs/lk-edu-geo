build provenance:

```yaml
name: Publish to npm

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish @intuitui-labs/lk-edu-geo
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 12.4.2

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'

      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm run check-types
      - run: pnpm run test
      - run: pnpm run build

      - name: Publish Package
        run: npm publish --access public --provenance
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```
